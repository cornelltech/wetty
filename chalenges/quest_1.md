### Quest 1 ###
This is a training mission.

A hacker has managed to infect your computer with a malware.
The malware might destroy your files and infect other machines.

Once you login to your computer, you have 5 minutes to desactivate the malware.

The hacker was a little sloppy and left some traces behind.

1. From the current folder, look for a file named `footsteps.txt`.

2. Read the content of the file to find out the pid of the process running the malware.

3. Terminate the process using the `kill` command.

4. The malware process is being run as a different user. You need to impersonate the user in order to terminate the process. To do so, you need  the password the hacker used. Look for a file `pwgen.txt`.

5. Impersonate the hacker.

6. Terminate the process.

You successfully completed your mission.
