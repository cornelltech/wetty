This is a very important message.

Some agents from the Capitol have infected the mainframe computer running the powerplant for all District 12 with a malware.
The malware will most likely destroy some files, infect other machines and shuts down the power for all inhabitants of the District.

According to our intelligence sources, we have less than 5 minutes desactivate the malware.

May the odds be ever in your favor!

K@tniss.

The agent working for the Capital was a little sloppy and left some traces behind.

From the current folder, look for a file named footsteps.txt.

Read the content of the file to find out the pid of the process running the malware.

Terminate the process using the kill command.

The malware process is being run as a different user. You need to impersonate the user in order to terminate the process. To do so, you need the password the hacker used. Look for a file pwgen.txt.

Impersonate the user.

Terminate the process.

You successfully completed your mission.
