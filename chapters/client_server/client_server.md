This chapter would follow another chapter where you got a username and password to log in to someone else's computer.  Let's say this is the Katniss evil government computer.

The mission is to change their website from saying something mean to saying something nice.

There is a file in the home directory that is being served.  The 'other' website could be just a different path like /evil-website/ and we can provide a link to that, so they can open another tab that can see that website.  Or we could just have it on the same page, maybe a little preview of their site, this would be a little less realistic though.

So they need to change this file and then reload the 'other' website to see if the change worked.
